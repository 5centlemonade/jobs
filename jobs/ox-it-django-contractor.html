# Python/Django contractor

[IT Services](https://github.com/ox-it) at the [University of
Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) are seeking a Python/Django contractor to help
develop an internal VoIP phone management application, with
an initial contract length of three months.

The application was initially developed to gather information prior to the
rollout of a new VoIP telephone system, but there is now a need to expand this
into an administrative tool for managing users’ telephone accounts, numbers and
voice mailboxes.  Several systems need to be integrated, including the OpenScape
telephone system itself and other modules.

The application is developed on GitHub, following the [GitFlow methodology](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

We’re looking for someone with the following skills:

* A good knowledge of, and proficiency with, Python and its ecosystem
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [django-rest-framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
* [Celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/) (and [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com/) as a bonus)
* Working with HTTP-based APIs (experience of SOAP in Python also useful)
* HTML
* Experience developing sustainable JavaScript
* git
* Test-driven development

We’re open to the contractor working primarily remotely, but they should be able
to attend meetings and stand-ups on at least one day a week.

For more information, or to express an interest, please contact
<jemima.spare@it.ox.ac.uk>, with your CV, stating your availability and your day
rate if you wish to be considered.
