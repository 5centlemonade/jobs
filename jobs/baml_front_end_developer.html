# Job Description

We are looking for Python developers to join our teams in our Downtown offices. We are looking for individuals who have interest
and expertise in bulding responsive web interfaces using Python and other web-based tools such as HTML5, CSS and Angular.

We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Financial experience is desirable but not a requirment. We can offer flexible conditions
and a stimulating, creative atmosphere. We have vacancies for both contractors and permanent employees.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting, this is primarily an office based role.
* No agencies please

# Requirements

Fluency in Python, plus common web-development languages (e.g. HTML, CSS). Anything else you might bring to the job is a bonus.

We use a lot of other technologies: in an organisation as big as Bank of America we have just about any technology you might think of.
But if you come to us with the ability to use Python, HTML and CSS well, then we might not ask what else you know about.

If you fit this description, please just email a resume to robert.donnelly@baml.com. There's no need to send a covering
letter (unless you really want to).

# About the Company

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We are an equal opportunities
employer and positively encourage applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race,
disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief.
