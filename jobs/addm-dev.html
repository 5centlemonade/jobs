# More about the product

It's called ADDM and it scans people's networks and provides detailed information about the hardware and software it finds, including dependencies between them.

Building it involves working in a whole load of interesting areas: the actual discovery of things over the network, of course, but also developing rich web-based UIs to help our users slice and dice the data, and cutting-edge back-end features to automatically manage and process vast quantities of information. Behind the scenes there are loads of deep technical challenges to solve, from our custom, clusterable NoSQL graph database, to multi-threaded and cross-machine server-side code, and a couple of custom domain-specific programming languages. Almost all of it is written in Python.

# Who we're looking for

We have no specific requirements. While knowledge of Python, JavaScript, Linux, and TCP/IP are all great, the main thing we're looking for is a great developer.

# How to apply

Send your CV and a covering letter to [addmjobs@bmc.com](mailto:addmjobs@bmc.com). Please, no 8-page CVs full of buzzwords. Show us your coding skills and passion.
