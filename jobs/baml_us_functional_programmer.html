# Job Description

We are looking for back-end developers to join our teams in our Downtown offices. 

We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Financial experience is desirable but not a requirment.
We can offer flexible conditions and a stimulating, creative atmosphere. We have vacancies for both contractors and permanent
employees.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting, this is primarily an office based role.
* No agencies please

# Requirements

Fluency in at least one of the programming languages we use (Python, Scala, JavaSceipt - including variants such as 
CoffeeScript or TypeScript): That means in addition to knowing the core of a language, we expect knowledge of its types
and standard library. Anything else you might bring to the job is a bonus.

We use many other technologies: in an organisation as big as Bank of America we have just about any technology you might think of.
But if you come to us with the ability to use Python, Scala or Javascript well, then we might not ask what else you know about.

If you fit this description, please just email a resume to robert.donnelly@baml.com. We do not require a covering letter.

# About the Company

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We are an equal opportunities
employer and positively encourage applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race,
disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief.
