# Job Description

We are looking for back-end developers to join our New York teams.

We consider developers from all backgrounds and all levels of experience. Financial experience is desirable but not a requirment.
We can offer flexible conditions and a stimulating, creative atmosphere. We have vacancies for both contractors and permanent
employees.

# Restrictions

* No telecommuting, this is primarily an office based role.
* No agencies please

# Requirements

Fluency in at least one of the programming languages we use (Python, Scala or JavaScript - including variants such as 
CoffeeScript or TypeScript). That means in addition to knowing the syntax of a language, we expect in-depth knowledge of its types
and standard library. 

# How to apply

Please just email a resume to robert.donnelly@baml.com. We do not require a covering letter.

Our assessment process will include the following:
* A web-based programming challenge to be completed in your own time
* At least one face-to-face interview, which may include a pair-programming exercise

# About the Company

Bank of America Merrill Lynch is a multinational banking and financial services corporation. We are an equal opportunities
employer and positively encourage applications from suitably qualified and eligible candidates regardless of sex, race,
disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief.
