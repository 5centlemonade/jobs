# Overview

We are seeking an enthusiastic and experienced senior Python engineer to architect and build a high-bandwidth pipeline for biomedical data. The candidate will be responsible for operational performance, data integrity, and development of a control dashboard. The pipeline will handle tens of terabytes per tissue sample, in the form of images and genetic sequence data, and make it available to world-class researchers. Processing will involve image filtering, machine vision, machine learning, sequencing, bioinformatics, creation of 3D spatial data, and database storage.
 
# Responsibilities

This is a ground-floor opportunity to join a startup, and enable breakthroughs on the cutting edge of genetics and medicine. ReadCoor is building a new tool that combines microscopy and gene sequencing to provide high-precision, three-dimensional localization of biomolecules in complex samples. As part of our new and rapidly-growing team, you will:
 
Be responsible for architecting and delivering the software behind a completely new kind of spatial genetic sequencing tool.
Work closely with other talented software engineers and biomedical researchers, largely PhDs and engineers with deep industry experience.
Work on projects such as mapping trillions of individual neurons in the brain, or investigating pathogens associated with early childhood diseases and epidemics.
Qualifications

# Required
At least a bachelor’s degree in computer science or relevant field
Minimum 4 years experience as a developer
Demonstrated exceptional coding ability in Python and at least one other language
Experience with distributed systems, workflows, and message queues.
Experience implementing and using RESTful APIs
Experience with a relational database such as Postgres (preferred) or MySQL.
Experience with git, build systems, and testing tools.
Good communication and collaboration skills
 
# Nice to have
Experience with Amazon AWS and Docker
Experience with GIS (especially 3D) spatial databases, such as the PostGIS extender for Postgres
Experience with biomedical machine vision, or machine learning
Experience with bioinformatics and work with genetics datasets
Experience with full-stack development including various Javascript frameworks
Company Overview:
ReadCoor has introduced and is leading the next generation of “omics” by delivering the first panomic spatial sequencing platform to a global audience of researchers, clinicians, pharma, diagnostics companies, and ultimately patients. This is made possible with a fundamental new technology called FISSEQ which simultaneously enables integration of high throughput sequencing, morphometric analysis, cellular location and three-dimensional spatial imaging. This uniquely powerful tool is the first and only implementation of “In-situ Sequencing” and will revolutionize the next phase in understanding the transcriptome, introducing vast new opportunities for important and meaningful clinical insight.  ReadCoor will fulfill the mission with a comprehensive set of high quality services, systems and actionable information provided to research and healthcare communities worldwide.
